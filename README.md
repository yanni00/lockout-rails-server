### What the project entailed
My first project on Ruby on Rails was intended for me to learn how tables of information relate to one another and how to deploy onto the Heroku environment for development testing.
It had to have:
- at least 3 models.
- Include sign up/log in functionality
- Have complete RESTful routes
- ORM utilisation to create a database table structure
- Include Wireframes
- Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
- Be deployed online and accessible by public
